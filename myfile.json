  "text": "\"My Dearest Mother,\n\nSo thick is the smoke in this cellar that I can hardly see by a candle 12 ins. away, and so thick are the inmates that I can hardly write for pokes, nudges, and jolts. On my left the Company Commander snores on a bench: other officers repose on wire beds behind me. A great number of officers live as village lads in dug-outs, by day; but come into the safer places down here to sleep.\n\nI live, but heaven knows how, and I shall never be able to convey to you the nature of the sensations. ... The floor is 4 ins. deep in blood, and mud.\n\nThis must be the most frightful [war] there has ever been. ... The extraordinary thing is the cheerfulness of the troops. ... I fear that there is not a man of this Company but will be killed. They are all young, simple, fresh, and happy in the trench. It is very good to be alive, O 'man, and to be a man!\"."
